# RSA by Hand

This repository implements the RSA algorithm in Go, demonstrating the steps of encryption and decryption. It supports keys generated by common tools. The goal of this mini project is to provide an understanding of how RSA works under the hood.

## Key Generation

Private key generation can be done using OpenSSL. The following command generates a 2048-bit RSA private key and saves it to `key/private_key.pem`:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key/private_key.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
```

Extract the public key from the private key using:

```bash
openssl rsa -in key/private_key.pem -pubout -out key/public_key.pem
```

Now, you can inspect the keys:

```bash
openssl pkey -in private_key.pem -text -noout
openssl pkey -pubin -in public_key.pem -text -noout
```

The private key should contain the following fields:
- `modulus`: the product of two large prime numbers, `p` and `q`
- `publicExponent`: the exponent `e` used for encryption, typically `65537`
- `privateExponent`: the exponent `d` used for decryption
- `prime1` and `prime2`: the two prime factors of the modulus
- `exponent1` and `exponent2`: the exponents for the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)
- `coefficient`: the inverse of `prime2` modulo `prime1`

The public key only contains the `modulus` and `publicExponent` used for encryption.
